# Sorting Visualizer Web Application
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This web application allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. You can gain a better understanding of how these sorting algorithms work by watching them sort data in real-time. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the sorting algorithms available in this visualizer.

## Sorting Algorithms
1. Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
It divides the input into smaller sections, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
Known for its stability and efficiency.

2. Quick Sort
Quick Sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
It selects a "pivot" element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays.
One of the fastest sorting algorithms, often used in practice.

3. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Simple to understand but less efficient for large datasets.

4. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
It is efficient for small datasets and is often used for building more complex algorithms.

5. Selection Sort
Selection Sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element and moving it to the beginning.
It's straightforward but not as efficient as other sorting methods for larger datasets.

## How to Use
Select a sorting algorithm from the menu.
Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a new array of elements to be sorted.
Adjust the speed slider to control the visualization speed.
You can increase the size of the input array by using the size slider.
Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
Watch as the algorithm visually sorts the elements, and observe how different algorithms perform.

## Features
Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
Adjustable animation speed to suit your learning pace.
Generate new arrays for sorting at any time.
Gain insights into the mechanics of each sorting algorithm.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to enhance this Sorting Visualizer. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

## Usage
Visit the [Live Demo](https://sortjs.vercel.app/) to explore the application.
Add your expenses and income on the respective pages.
Check the Dashboard and Transactions pages to monitor your finances.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
